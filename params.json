{"name":"YO, IT’S A GRB","tagline":"Yo-ing from space since 2014","body":"# YO, IT’S A GRB!\r\n\r\nYOITSAGRB is a web service that sends you a [Yo](http://www.justyo.co/)\r\nwhenever a [gamma-ray burst](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-ray_burst)\r\noccurs in the known universe. With our current gamma-ray observatories, humans\r\ndetect a new GRB every few days, give or take.\r\n\r\n## How do I subscribe?\r\n\r\nJust send a Yo to the username YOITSAGRB.\r\n\r\n## Why should I subscribe?\r\n\r\n*For those who aren’t professional astronomers*: It’s cool! Every time you\r\nget a Yo, somewhere in the universe a massive star has exploded, blasting out\r\na relativistic shock wave that we can detect from millions of light-years\r\naway.\r\n\r\n*For those who are professional astronomers*: If you’re interested in rapid\r\nGRB followup, you’ll get your Yo about 10 seconds after the trigger email.\r\nThat usually works out to a 30-second turnaround from when the event is\r\nactually detected. Also, it’s still cool!\r\n\r\n## How do I learn more about GRBs?\r\n\r\nThe [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-ray_burst) is\r\ndefinitely a good place to start. You can also check out [NASA’s\r\npage](http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/bursts.html) on the\r\ntopic or listen to [one of their\r\npodcasts](http://asd.gsfc.nasa.gov/blueshift/index.php/2007/05/24/episode-2-life-and-death-may-2007/).\r\nThere are videos to watch in a [NASA press\r\nkit](http://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/details.cgi?aid=11407) related to one of\r\nthe brightest bursts ever seen. Finally, you can even [read a\r\nbook](http://www.amazon.com/Gamma-Ray-Bursts-Princeton-Frontiers-Physics/dp/0691145571/)!\r\n\r\n## How does it work under the hood?\r\n\r\nSee the source code linked above, especially `grb.py`. There’s absolutely\r\nnothing fancy: we get [GCN](http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/) email alerts, and\r\ntranslate them into Yos.\r\n\r\n## Who’s responsible for this?\r\n\r\n[Philip\r\nCowperthwaite](http://astronomy.fas.harvard.edu/people/philip-cowperthwaite)\r\nand [Peter K. G. Williams](http://newton.cx/~peter/).\r\n\r\n## Can I copy the code to start my own similar project?\r\n\r\nMost definitely.
