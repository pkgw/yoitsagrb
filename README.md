# YO, IT’S A GRB!

YOITSAGRB is a web service that sends you a [Yo](http://www.justyo.co/)
whenever a [gamma-ray burst](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-ray_burst)
occurs in the known universe.

## How do I subscribe?

Just send a Yo to the username YOITSAGRB.

## Why should I subscribe?

**For those who aren’t professional astronomers**: It’s cool! Every time you
get a Yo, somewhere in the universe a hypermassive star has exploded, blasting
out an relativistic shock wave that we can detect millions of light-years
away.

**For those who are professional astronomers**: If you’re interested in rapid
GRB followup, you’ll get your Yo about 10 seconds after the trigger email.
That usually works out to a 30-second turnaround from when the event is
actually detected. Also, it’s still cool!

## How does it work?

See the source code linked above. There’s absolutely nothing fancy: we get
GCN email alerts, and translate them into Yos.

## Who’s responsible for this?

[Philip
Cowperthwaite](http://astronomy.fas.harvard.edu/people/philip-cowperthwaite)
and [Peter K. G. Williams](http://newton.cx/~peter/).
