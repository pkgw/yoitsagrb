# YO, IT’S A GRB!

YOITSAGRB is a web service that sends you a [Yo](http://www.justyo.co/)
whenever a [gamma-ray burst](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-ray_burst)
occurs in the known universe.

## How do I subscribe?

Just send a Yo to the username YOITSAGRB.

## Why should I subscribe?

*For those who aren’t professional astronomers*: It’s cool! Every time you
get a Yo, somewhere in the universe a massive star has exploded, blasting out
a relativistic shock wave that we can detect from millions of light-years
away.

*For those who are professional astronomers*: If you’re interested in rapid
GRB followup, you’ll get your Yo about 10 seconds after the trigger email.
That usually works out to a 30-second turnaround from when the event is
actually detected. Also, it’s still cool!

## How do I learn more about GRBs?

The [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-ray_burst) is
definitely a good place to start. You can also check out [NASA’s
page](http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/bursts.html) on the
topic or listen to [one of their
podcasts](http://asd.gsfc.nasa.gov/blueshift/index.php/2007/05/24/episode-2-life-and-death-may-2007/).
There are videos to watch in a [NASA press
kit](http://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/details.cgi?aid=11407) related to one of
the brightest bursts ever seen. Finally, you can even [read a
book](http://www.amazon.com/Gamma-Ray-Bursts-Princeton-Frontiers-Physics/dp/0691145571/)!

## How does it work?

See the source code linked above. There’s absolutely nothing fancy: we get
GCN email alerts, and translate them into Yos.

## Who’s responsible for this?

[Philip
Cowperthwaite](http://astronomy.fas.harvard.edu/people/philip-cowperthwaite)
and [Peter K. G. Williams](http://newton.cx/~peter/).
